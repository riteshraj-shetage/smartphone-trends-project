- What features influence smartphone purchase decisions?
- What tasks do users primarily use their smartphones for?
- Do usage patterns vary by region or occupation?
- Are there any health issues linked to prolonged smartphone usage?
- How does screen time correlate with user satisfaction and productivity?
